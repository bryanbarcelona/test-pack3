## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **New event type:** `FileAddedEvent`
  - Represents the successful addition of a new file to the filesystem.
  - Includes metadata: `file_path`, `file_size`, `is_healthy`, and `timestamp`.
- **Convenience function:** `publish_file_added()`
  - Simplifies emitting `FileAddedEvent` to the global event bus.
  - Ensures consistent structure and timestamping across components.

- **Event publishing integration across download sources:**
  - `download_dropbox_audio()` now publishes a `FileAddedEvent` immediately after each Dropbox audio file is saved and verified.
  - `download_attachment_handler()` now publishes a `FileAddedEvent` after each successfully saved PDF email attachment.
  - `download_pdf_handler()` now publishes a `FileAddedEvent` after successful download of a PDF from an embedded link.
  - `TechemScraper` now publishes a `FileAddedEvent` after successfully downloading and verifying a Techem PDF invoice.
  - `KfwScraper` now publishes a `FileAddedEvent` after each successfully downloaded and healthy KfW PDF document.

### Changed
- Event payloads now carry:
  - Full, resolved file path
  - File size in bytes
  - Health status of the downloaded file
  - Timestamp for event traceability
- Event publishing occurs **at the exact point of file creation** for strong consistency between disk state and event state.

### Developer Notes
- All publishing uses the `publish_file_added()` helper for consistency.
- Failed or unhealthy downloads are not published.
- The new event integrates seamlessly with existing `_handle_file_added()` logic to update expected filesystem state in downstream consumers.


## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-95

### Changed

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-11

### Added - VideoSith Module

#### Overview
New `VideoSith` module for normalizing video files to timestamped MP4 format with full metadata preservation. Handles MOV → MP4 conversion, intelligent renaming based on EXIF data, and timezone-aware filename generation.

#### Core Features
- **Video Format Conversion**
  - MOV to MP4 conversion using FFmpeg
  - Smart codec strategy: attempts stream copy first (fast), falls back to H.264 re-encoding if needed
  - Preserves all metadata during conversion (EXIF, GPS, creation dates)
  - Automatic cleanup of original files after successful conversion

- **Metadata Processing**
  - Extracts creation dates, GPS coordinates, and timezone information
  - Calculates video start time by subtracting duration from end time
  - GPS-based timezone detection using TimezoneFinder
  - Parses dates from filenames (pattern: `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`) as fallback
  - Determines UTC offsets from timezone or filename comparison

- **Intelligent Naming**
  - Generates timestamp-based filenames: `YYYYMMDD HHMMSS.mp4`
  - Applies timezone adjustments when offset available
  - Adds `_UTC` suffix when timezone cannot be determined
  - Automatic conflict resolution with numbered suffixes: `(1)`, `(2)`, etc.

- **Apple Integration**
  - Detects and removes Apple sidecar files (.xmp, .aae, hidden variants)
  - Cleans up both before and after processing

#### Module Structure

```
videosith/
├── __init__.py           # Package exports
├── converter.py          # FFmpegConverter - video format conversion
├── metadata.py           # MetadataReader - EXIF extraction
├── metadata_writer.py    # MetadataWriter - writing metadata to files
├── naming.py             # PathStrategy - filename generation logic
└── videosith.py          # VideoSith - main orchestrator
```

#### Architecture Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module handles one aspect of processing
- **Dependency Injection**: All external tools (FFmpeg, ExifTool) injectable
- **Abstract Interfaces**: `VideoConverter` ABC enables future format support
- **Stateless Logic**: `PathStrategy` uses pure functions for predictability
- **Testability**: Components can be mocked/stubbed independently

#### API

**Basic Usage:**
```python
from videosith import VideoSith

# Create processor
processor = VideoSith()

# Convert MOV to MP4
processor.open("video.mov")
processor.convert_to_mp4()  # Returns bool

# Rename existing MP4
processor.open("video.mp4")
processor.rename_mp4()
```

**Custom Dependencies:**
```python
from videosith import VideoSith, MetadataReader, FFmpegConverter

# Inject custom tool paths
reader = MetadataReader(exiftool_path="/custom/exiftool")
converter = FFmpegConverter(ffmpeg_path="/custom/ffmpeg")

processor = VideoSith(
    metadata_reader=reader,
    converter=converter
)
```

#### Processing Pipeline

**MOV → MP4 Conversion:**
1. Extract metadata from source MOV
2. Generate target path based on metadata
3. Convert to MP4 (stream copy or re-encode)
4. Write metadata to new MP4
5. Delete original MOV
6. Clean up Apple sidecars

**MP4 Renaming:**
1. Extract metadata from existing MP4
2. Generate target path based on metadata
3. Rename file if needed
4. Write/update metadata
5. Clean up Apple sidecars

#### Dependencies
- `exiftool` - Metadata reading/writing
- `ffmpeg` - Video format conversion
- `pytz` - Timezone calculations
- `timezonefinder` - GPS to timezone mapping

#### Error Handling
- Custom exceptions: `ConversionError`, `MetadataWriteError`
- Timeout protection on subprocess calls (5-10 minutes)
- Automatic cleanup on conversion failures
- Graceful degradation when metadata unavailable

#### Naming Examples

| Scenario | Output Filename |
|----------|----------------|
| GPS + timezone data | `20240315 093000.mp4` (local time) |
| Creation date only | `20240315 143000_UTC.mp4` |
| No metadata | `original_filename.mp4` |
| Conflict detected | `20240315 093000(1).mp4` |

#### Technical Details
- Video start time calculated by subtracting `MediaDuration` from `CreateDate`
- Timezone offset determined from GPS coordinates using IANA timezone database
- Fallback offset calculation compares filename date to EXIF date
- ExifTool commands use shell parsing for complex parameter handling
- FFmpeg timeouts: 5 min (stream copy), 10 min (re-encode)

#### Future Enhancements
- Support for additional input formats (AVI, MKV, etc.)
- Configurable naming patterns
- Batch processing API
- Progress callbacks for long conversions
- Health check validation after conversion

    - Publishes `FileRenamedEvent` for temp → final renames
    - Conditionally executes only if `processor_class` provided

  - Encapsulated in `AppleSidecarManager` with discovery, renaming, and deletion utilities
  - `AppleSidecarManager.delete_image_with_sidecars()`: Atomic deletion of image + sidecars
    - Publishes `file_deleted` events for each removed file with accurate sizes

### Changed
- `DirectoryVerifier` now subscribes to copy and rename events, updating expected state
  - Remains path-only by design—health & size fields ignored

### Known Issues
- HEIC files use size-only health checks in Phase 1 staging
  - Not yet registered in `_FILETYPE_CHECKERS` mimetype dispatcher
  - Will be addressed when HEIC validation is implemented in health checker utilities


## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-01

  - Handlers report detailed outcomes (e.g., "Downloaded 3/5 documents")
- **Success semantics**: Stricter definition of success
  - Now requires ALL documents downloaded successfully (was: at least one)
  - Partial success (e.g., 3/5 docs) now returns `success=False`
  - Prevents premature email deletion on partial failures
- **Code organization**: Extracted procedural logic into focused private methods
  - `_login()`, `_download_pdf()`, `_capture_download_request()`, etc.
  - `_execute_download_workflow()`, `_attempt_login()`, `_attempt_navigation()` for flat control flow
  - Keeps main `download()` method readable while handling complex flows
  - Error handling remains visible in main orchestration method

#### Removed
- Dead code: unused download_kfw_single_document helper function
- Unused imports: DoctopusPrime, os, dotenv, dataclasses
- Commented-out development code

#### Fixed
- Browser resources now always cleaned up via try/finally pattern
